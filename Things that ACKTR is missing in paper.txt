Things that ACKTR is missing in paper:

1. missing parenthesis for k-step return
2. activation is ReLU
3. sampling is not softmax sampling or eps-greedy, as in REINFORCE/A2C, but
rather a weird noise additon with log(log(noise))
4. mse is mse/2 (in addition to the 0.5* in the paper)
5. ASYNC
6. not calculating k-step returns really. for every batch of 20 steps, they are
actually calculating 20-, 19-, etc step returns.
